    text: >
      The mod version of the game means a modification or enhancement program of the game. In fact, it can be seen in the English translation that mod is the abbreviation of the English word modification, which means modification, and the Chinese is also transliterated as "module". In layman's terms, on the basis of the original game, the programming boss in the player will try to modify some data settings in the game, such as characters, enemies, things, as well as the appearance and voice of the characters, weapons, tools, maps, etc. Wait, write a new mission story to make the modified game more playable.

Navigating the game can be difficult for players new to the game. Next, I have prepared practical strategies for players who are new to this game. Even if you are an old player, it doesn't matter, let's see what you missed!

##Upgrade ships and weapons

A newly purchased ship or weapon will only function to a fraction of its maximum potential. You'll need to use upgrade points to improve their stats, such as ship health and speed as well as weapon damage and range. For the best performance in battle, you'll want to have a fully upgraded ship with fully upgraded weapons.

When you put points on an attribute, the first three upgrades are always successful. After that, however, the chances of a successful upgrade will decrease with each upgrade level. This means that the more you upgrade a certain attribute, the more upgrade points you will need to multiply. So instead of focusing on a single stat like speed or health, split your points evenly across different stats. You may want to start with all attributes upgraded to at least level 3. Then upgrade each attribute to level 4, to level 5, and so on. This will ensure you get the most out of your upgrade points.

A ship with all stats at 3 will perform better than a ship with one stat maxed at 10 and another with zero. Once you've accumulated enough upgrade points, you'll be able to upgrade your favorite ships to the highest level, making them perform at their best in battle.

##Use supplies at the right time

Coming under enemy fire will quickly sink your ship, but effective use of consumables can boost your survivability. There are three types of consumables in Modern Warships: Countermeasures, Repair kits, and Ammo Reserves.

##Countermeasures

Countermeasures are chaff and flares used to confuse enemy weapon systems. When you activate the Counter's consumable, enemy missiles locked onto your ship will lose their target and fly in different directions, rendering them useless. You should try to use these countermeasures tactically. This is because consumables have a limited number of uses and cooldowns. Therefore, only activate countermeasures when necessary. You can always see how many enemy missiles are locked onto you by looking at the missile warning icon. Enemy missiles locked onto you are marked with a red missile icon above them.

>Most ships have air defense CIWS (Close-in Weapon System) that can track and shoot down enemy missiles. CIWS are usually able to take out one or two enemy missiles, so wait until you are under a larger barrage of enemy missiles before using countermeasures.

##Repair Kits

Repair kits are also known as damage control. This consumable will repair your ship and replenish your health. Since Repair Kits replenish a fixed amount of health, try not to use Repair Kits until you're down to around 80% health. Otherwise, the healing effect will be largely wasted, as you cannot heal above 100% health. It's best to use repair kits as soon as possible to maximize the number of heals per match. Keep an eye on cooldowns and listen for audio cues telling you that a repairman is ready, and if your health drops below 80%, use it now.

>If you run out of consumables, you can use the in-game shop to replenish them. Use in-game cash to buy a set of consumables.

##Ammo Reserves

Many of the weapons in the game, such as missiles, have a maximum amount of ammo that you can carry in combat. While this might not happen often, sometimes a match drags on for so long that you'll run out of ammo. When this happens, you can use your Ammo Reserve consumable to get some extra ammo to keep you in combat longer. While this isn't common, it's a good idea to stock up on the Ammo Reserve consumable just in case you end up with a protracted fight, and having more ammo will give you an edge against your opponent.

##Scout the Map

Early scouting is a key strategy for winning the game. With effective scouting, you stand a better chance against the enemy team. Spotting enemies quickly is key to gaining the edge in the game. If your team fails to scout the map, you'll quickly be hit by a barrage of enemy missiles from the other side of the map, with no way to fight back.

If your team has aircraft carriers, launching fighter jets is the fastest way to expose enemy positions. However, sometimes the allied CV can't do that, and sometimes the matchmaker will put you in a lobby without an aircraft carrier. In this case, you'll need to rely on your helicopter to scout the map. Just fire up your helicopter, switch controls to it, and fly it to the other side of the map. Hidden enemies are shown as red dots on the minimap. Head to the nearest red dot on the screen and enemy ships will be spotted in no time. At this point, you can return control to your ship and start firing missiles at the enemy fleet.

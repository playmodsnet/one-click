##Basic Game Controls

During the game, your players can pass the ball, play in the middle or cross, and shoot in various ways to organize the team game and score goals. You don't have much influence over how the player acts, although they will always try to do what you ask of them. Of course, their success will always vary based on several factors, including their stats - and sometimes, asking too much of a player with poor stats can lead to them missing passes or shots, or being completely blocked by opposing defenders.

[FIFA Soccer Mobile Mod Apk](https://www.popularmodapk.com/fifa-soccer-menu-apk/com.ea.gp.fifamobile1) has dedicated buttons for all actions that change dynamically depending on the context. For example, you'll have buttons to defend and tackle if you're defending. Meanwhile, if you're on offense, the same buttons change to pass, shot, and sprint. Alternatively, FIFA Soccer also allows you to control most offenses with gestures, by swiping or tapping on the screen. For example, when you're ready to shoot, you can swipe toward an enemy's target instead of tapping a button, letting your player shoot in the desired trajectory. Additionally, you can tap on teammates to pass the ball to them, or you can tap in front of them for a cross or through the ball and your players will automatically determine the best option for the situation.

##Team and Formation

First and foremost, the most important stat to give you an idea of your team's strength is the overall rating, which appears front and center on the main menu screen and in caps in the "My Team" menu. A higher overall rating usually means your team is better, as this number represents the average of all players' overall rating stats. The higher this stat is compared to the opposing team, the better your chances of scoring. Of course, another important aspect of winning games is the players you bring onto the pitch. But in other words, even if you know how to play, if your team stats are low, you may find it difficult to shoot, pass and defend properly.

Your formation, while less important, can also make a big difference when playing against certain teams. We say it's not that important, not because it's actually unimportant, but because most alternate formations unlock progressively as you play the game, so you don't need to worry too much about it at first. However, depending on the enemy's formation, you can adjust your formation to neutralize their strengths or exploit your weaknesses. Remember to keep player strengths in mind as well, as changing formation affects your team as much as the enemy.

##Training Players

The best and most direct way to improve your team's overall rating, at least initially, is to buy new players and replace weak players in your formation. However, this can be very expensive, as the best player cards can cost a lot of currency. Luckily, while you can get some good cards at the start by completing kick-off challenges, there is another way to slightly improve your OVR by training your players: through the My Team menu, your players can be clicked to train them. The way you do this is by actually sacrificing other player cards in the same position to generate XP which will help boost your player. Every time a player levels up, their stats increase, enhancing their abilities. Eventually, their OVR will also increase, increasing your chances of winning.
